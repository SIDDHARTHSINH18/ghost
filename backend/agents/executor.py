"""
GHOST — foundational agent execution (M3-D).

Executes a Task's tool call through the existing GHOST
security stack, in this exact order:

  Task -> Agent -> PermissionPolicy -> ToolRegistry -> tool -> result

Rules enforced here:
- Permission is checked BEFORE any tool execution.
- ALLOW            -> tool runs, Task COMPLETED (or FAILED).
- REQUIRE_APPROVAL -> nothing executes; a clear
  approval-required result is returned and the Task
  stays PENDING until a later M3 step handles approval.
- DENY (DANGEROUS / unknown tool) -> nothing executes;
  Task FAILED with the reason in error.

Tool execution itself is injected as a callable
(tool_name, params) -> Any, so real integrations can be
added in later milestones while tests use a deterministic
mock. This is not a second orchestrator: model-level
orchestration stays in core.orchestrator (this module can
be attached to its existing `agents` registry).

        returns an awaitable, it is awaited inside the caller's
