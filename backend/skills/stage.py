"""
GHOST — skill stage (M4 step 5).

Wires the existing skill system into the task pipeline without
adding a second one:

  requirement -> SkillRouter.select() (exactly once)
              -> SkillSelection (recorded in the ExecutionSpec
                 and the audit log)
              -> SkillRunner.execute() (only for a skill that
                 is both matched and runnable)

Two rules this layer adds on top of the existing pieces:

- ROUTE ONCE. The router is consulted a single time per
  request, and the ranked candidates it returned are reused
  for selection, spec, audit and execution. The pipeline
  cannot disagree with itself about what was chosen.
- RUNNABLE BEFORE RUN. A skill executes only when every tool
  in its required_tools is present in the ToolRegistry. That
  is metadata, so the decision happens before any skill
  implementation is imported. A matched-but-unrunnable skill
  is reported the same way as "nothing matched" — router.py
  already defines no-match as a safe fallback to the plain
  task path, not an error.

Execution still goes through SkillRunner -> Agent ->
PermissionPolicy: this module never runs a tool and never
decides a permission.
