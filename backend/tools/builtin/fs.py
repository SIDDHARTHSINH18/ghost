GHOST — safe filesystem read tools (M3-H steps 1 and 6).

fs_read_file: read a local text file. Read-only.

Safety constraints, enforced HERE in code (treat params
as untrusted model output):
- path may be absolute, or relative: it is resolved against
  the canonical execution root by the centralized resolver
- relative paths may never traverse above the canonical root
  (textual ".." escapes are rejected before any filesystem
  access)
- path must exist and be a regular file / directory (no
  device/symlink tricks via isfile + islink rejection)
- file size must be <= MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES
- decoded as UTF-8 with errors="replace" (never raises
  on binary junk; result is always deterministic text)
- no writing, no globbing, no shell
