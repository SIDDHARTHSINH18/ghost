GHOST — production task service (M3-H step 2).

In-process store around the existing Task model
(backend/core/task.py). The service owns task
lifecycle bookkeeping only: no execution, no
approval, no planning, no persistence — those live
elsewhere (Agent/AutomationEngine now; approval and
planner in later steps).

Dependency direction is one-way:
    backend/tasks/service.py -> backend/core/task.py
Never the reverse.
